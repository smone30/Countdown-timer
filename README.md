Hey everyone! 🚀

I've been working on a cool web project that I'm excited to share with you all—a fully functional Countdown Timer ⏳! It's a simple but elegant tool that shows the remaining time until a special date, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This is a great project to improve your front-end web development skills.


Features:
✨ Responsive Design: Works beautifully on both desktop and mobile devices.
🎨 Clean and Minimalist: A modern design with pleasing colors for an aesthetic user experience.
⚙️ Real-Time Updates: Displays live updates of days, hours, minutes, and seconds left.

How it works:
Target Date: You can set any future date, and the timer will show the time left until then.
Mobile Friendly: It’s built to be fully responsive, so it looks great on smartphones too.
Automatic Expiration: Once the countdown reaches zero, a message will display, letting you know that the countdown has expired.
I’d love your feedback! 😊 Try it out and let me know what you think. Feel free to share it with anyone who could use a countdown for their next big event!
